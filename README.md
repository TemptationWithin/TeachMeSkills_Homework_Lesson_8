Exceptions
/**
* Write a program.
* Pass a string to the input (we will assume that this is a document number).
* The document number has the format xxxx-yyy-xxxx-yyy-xyxy
* where x is a number, and y is a letter.
*
* Display the first two blocks of 4 digits on one line
* ​​(do this using Pattern and Matcher)
*
* In the program for working with strings from the previous task, add work with exceptions.
* Namely, create two of your own exceptions. And you need to 'throw' them in cases when
* 1) the input string with the document number is of an invalid format (for example, longer or shorter),
* 2) if the input string begins with the sequence 1111, also 'throw' an exception
